# Alarm analysis integration with CrewLog
The scope of this project is to streamline the handover reporting of alarms between shifts offshore. Currently, operators collect alarm data and manually fills out a report with KPIs relevant for the workers on the next shift. The KPIs are filled out in an excel file that few people look at due to the complexity. The goal is to automate this process using CDF and Cognite Functions, presenting the KPIs in an easily interpretable manner, for rapid insight. The potential outcome is more valuable actions and better utilization of time, by improving our priorization of alarms that require actions from operators, and increased cross-functional understanding of the current status of alarms.
